**Philosophy & Approach**

<p>Primoris Academy was established on the firm belief that school should fuel, not stifle, a child's curiosity. We also believe that a learning environment befitting their level incites children to perform and develop at their true potential. Therefore, at Primoris, students are placed based on ability rather than by age, and experiential learning is at the core of our approach. Our program provides:

* early exposure to all subjects (e.g. world history, foreign language, STEM) starting in our youngest grades;
* frequent cross-curricular connections and interdisciplinary activities/assignments;
* extensive extracurricular and enrichment programming;
* unique learning opportunities such as team-based competitions, interaction with field experts, and monthly field trips.

Through an accelerated, rigorous program that emphasizes creativity and collaboration, we cultivate our students' ability to think critically and dream big.

*Primoris Academy is a non-profit, independent, private school certified by the State of New Jersey and accredited by AdvancED.* </p>

**Mission & Vision**

</p>Our mission is to foster children into thoughtful, inquisitive individuals with bold aspirations by giving them opportunities to grow not just academically, but in character.  We strive to educate the whole child by incorporating opportunities for practice in perseverance, responsibility, and integrity, as well as supported academic risk-taking, throughout our curricular structure. Our students will take natural interest and leadership in their school, local, and global communities, as well as engage with diverse perspectives and ideas.

As an innovative educational institution, we seek to redefine meaningful education in an era of rapid globalization and technological development by incorporating applicable skills needed in our 21st-century world. Relevant problem-solving and creative, critical thinking are present in our academic approach, as well as in connection to issues in our local and global communities. Primoris Academy students will engage with content based on their passions and interests, as well as exposed to subjects to inspire new passions and interests. 

We pledge to actively identify and create the educational opportunities greatly needed, such as STEM/STEAM programs for young girls and financial scholarships for students who may have unequal access to resources.</p>
