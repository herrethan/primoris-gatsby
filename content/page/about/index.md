**Philosophy & Approach**

**`<p>`**
Primoris Academy was established on the firm belief that school should fuel, not stifle, a child's curiosity. We also believe that a learning environment befitting their level incites children to perform and develop at their true potential. Therefore, at Primoris, students are placed based on ability rather than by age, and experiential learning is at the core of our approach. Our program provides:

* early exposure to all subjects (e.g. world history, foreign language, STEM) starting in our youngest grades;
* frequent cross-curricular connections and interdisciplinary activities/assignments;
* extensive extracurricular and enrichment programming;
* unique learning opportunities such as team-based competitions, interaction with field experts, and monthly field trips.

Through an accelerated, rigorous program that emphasizes creativity and collaboration, we cultivate our students' ability to think critically and dream big.

*Primoris Academy is a non-profit, independent, private school certified by the State of New Jersey and accredited by AdvancED.* `</p>`

**Mission & Vision**
Our mission is to foster children into thoughtful, inquisitive individuals with bold aspirations. Owing to a joyful, personal, and open education, our students will take natural interest and leadership in their school, local, and global communities.

As an innovative educational institution, we challenge educators both within and beyond our school to redefine what a meaningful education constitutes in an era of rapid globalization and technological development. We challenge the world to rethink how they view young people, and young people how they view themselvesâ€”about what is possible, by whom, and when or at what age. Finally, we pledge to actively identify and create the educational opportunities greatly needed, such as STEM/STEAM programs for young girls and financial scholarships for students who may have unequal access to resources.
