In evaluating each candidate, the Admissions Committee considers many factors throughout a holistic review process. Overall, we look for individuals who demonstrate intellectual curiosity and passion; an innate drive to learn, explore, question, and tinker; and creativity or inventiveness. We do not rely solely on grades, IQ tests, or other standardized testing. We evaluate the candidate's fit for and potential contribution to the distinctive Primoris experience.
To be considered for admission, please follow the steps below.

**1. SCHEDULE A PRIVATE TOUR OF THE SCHOOL (OPTIONAL)**
You can reach us via phone at (201) 722-1000, or via email at [admissions@primorisacademy.org](mailto:admissions@primorisacademy.org). Please see our school calendar.

**2. SUBMIT AN APPLICATION**
