In evaluating each candidate, the Admissions Committee considers many factors throughout a holistic review process. Overall, we look for individuals who demonstrate intellectual curiosity and passion; an innate drive to learn, explore, question, and tinker; and creativity or inventiveness. We do not rely solely on grades, IQ tests, or other standardized testing. We evaluate the candidate's fit for and potential contribution to the distinctive Primoris experience.
To be considered for admission, please follow the steps below.

**1. SCHEDULE A PRIVATE TOUR OF THE SCHOOL (OPTIONAL)**

You can reach us via phone at (201) 722-1000, or via email at [admissions@primorisacademy.org](mailto:admissions@primorisacademy.org). Please see our school calendar.

**2. SUBMIT AN APPLICATION**

Download and complete the relevant application below. Send completed applications to [admissions@primorisacademy.org](mailto:admissions@primorisacademy.org).

**3. SCHEDULE SHADOW DAYS**

Once you have submitted an application, contact us to schedule three consecutive school days for attending classes and shadowing students at Primoris. Applicants must commit to three full days.
Shadow days during the school year can be scheduled from October- May, pending schedule availability. Shadow days may also be scheduled during our summer program if there is space available.

**4. SUBMIT REMAINING APPLICATION MATERIALS**

* IQ Test (for ages 5 and older, optional)

Teachers should email their recommendations to [admissions@primorisacademy.org](mailto:admissions@primorisacademy.org) from their school email accounts. Recommendations sent from personal accounts will not be accepted.

**UPON RECEIPT OF ALL MATERIALS**
