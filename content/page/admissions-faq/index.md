###What is your tuition?
At Primoris, our students are placed into classes based on their ability instead of by age. Therefore, the final tuition amount depends on which class the child is placed in. 

###What is the student to teacher ratio/ average class size?
The maximum student to teacher ratio is 12:1. Classes average 7-8 students. Class sizes are kept small to maximize close attention to each student.

###What are shadow days?
Shadow days are 3 consecutive days in which an applying student will attend Primoris Academy from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.

###When can I set up shadow days for my student?
Shadow days are typically set up once we receive a completed application. 

###What should I expect during my child's shadow days?
Shadow students are encouraged to become a part of our student body and participate as much as they'd like! We ask that shadow students wear navy and white (our school colors) and bring snack, lunch, and a water bottle.

###Is there a fee for shadow days?
There is no fee for shadow days during the normal school year. If your student is shadowing during our summer program, there is a fee in the amount of the summer session.

###What hours is the school day?
Our regular school day is from 8 a.m.-2:50 p.m. Doors open at 7:55 a.m.

###What do I need to do after the shadow days?
Once the shadow days are completed, the rest of the necessary application materials (test (IQ, ERB, or SSAT/ISEE), teacher recommendation(s), copy of school transcripts) will need to be submitted to complete the application package. Once we have received all of the materials, a decision letter will be mailed home typically within 1-2 weeks.
