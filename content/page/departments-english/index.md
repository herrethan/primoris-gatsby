    <p>While fundamental concepts such as spelling and grammar are incorporated into our instruction, English/Language Arts courses are built on discussion, debate, and argument construction and defense. Students read and respond to a variety of complex texts throughout their course of study, as well as learn multiple writing styles to express both creative and analytical viewpoints.</p>
    <p>Students begin with foundational literacy, phonics, and handwriting, as well as exposure to text in supported instruction and independently. Students gradually build upon these skills using discussion strategies, workshops, and activities supported by student interest. We strive to build a culture of love and appreciation for reading and writing thorughout all levels and disciplines.</p>

    <h3>Reading Instruction</h3>
    <p>Students are encouraged to think deeply about their reading and develop arguments using text as evidence throughout their course schedule. Interdisciplinary instruction and practice of concepts is a key element of our instructional philosophy. Students are also exposed to multiple genres and styles of text throughout their study.</p>
    <h3>Writing Instruction</h3>
    <p>Students begin with creative and argument writing at a young age, learning key vocabulary and skills to practice during discussions. As students progress, they will practice three types of writing: Narrative, Argument/Analytical, and Informational, building upon their skills at each level.</p>
