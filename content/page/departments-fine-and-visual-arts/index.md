    <p>Fine/Visual Arts instruction focuses on not just the making of art, but the experience and impact of art and artists on our world. Students learn about periods in art history, art from across the globe, and are exposed to a variety of materials and techniques inspired by these movements. There is considerable connection between art instruction and history instruction throughout all levels.</p>
