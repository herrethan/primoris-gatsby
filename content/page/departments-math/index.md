    <p>With a strong focus on mental math and number sense concepts, Primoris Academy students are introduced to practical applications in mathematics at a young age. Through discussion, group work, and problem-solving, students will engage in mathematical concepts in both designed and real-life applications. Instruction is built for students to understand the WHY of math, rather than rote calculation sequences.<p>
    <p>Students continually practice the following skills:</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Logical Reasoning</li>
      <li>Creative and Critical Thinking</li>
      <li>Multi-Step Complex Problem Solving</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While practicing foundational skills, as well as divergent thinking, students continue their mathematical study through the following course sequence: Prealgebra, Algebra I, Geometry, Intermediate Algebra/Trigonometry, Precalculus, and Calculus.</p>
    <p>In keeping with our overall school philosophy, students progress through the mathematical course of study based on their academic readiness and maturity. Students have the opportunity to engage in higher-level math topics such as Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus after completing the defined course of study.</p>
