    <p>With a strong focus on mental math and number sense concepts, Primoris Academy students are introduced to practical application on mathematics at a young age. Through discussion, group work, and problem solving, students will engage in mathematical concepts in both designed and real-life applications.<p>
    <p>Students continually practice the following skills:</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Logical Reasoning</li>
      <li>Creative and Critical Thinking</li>
