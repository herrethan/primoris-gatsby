    <p>Music instruction concerns performance, as well as theory and composition. All students are required to learn a string instrument (violin or cello), which accounts for half of the music instruction. Students also engage in ensemble music, where their personal skills and talents are incorporated, and are given multiple opportunities for individual and group performance throughout the year. We also offer opportunities in musical theater.</p>
