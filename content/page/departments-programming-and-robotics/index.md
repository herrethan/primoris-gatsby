    <p>The Programming and Robotics course sequence is designed to encourage students to apply logical reasoning and problem solving. Students are introduced to coding through MIT's Scratch program and progress writing code in Python.  
    <p>In addition, students apply their coding to accessible robotics platforms such as Lego Mindstorm and Wonder Workshop. Students also have the opportunity to participate in the First Lego League robotics club and the American Computer Science League competition.</p>
