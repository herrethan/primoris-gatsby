Our high school is a close-knit cohort of mature, driven peers who challenge and collaborate with each other. Supported by faculty who match their curiosity and passion, students continue to explore widely and delve deeply; to hone their tools for rigorous intellectual inquiry and self-expression.

We offer three academic tracks, each of which is highly academically rigorous, which enables your adolescent child to progress towards his or her goals at a pace that's both comfortable and appropriately challenging.

##Traditional with Intensive AP

In Years 1-3 of high school, students continue the “4+1” schedule (4-day regular, 1-day elective) but take on a double science course load. Year 1 and 2 courses are mostly advanced honors courses, and APs are completed in Years 2-4. As time permits, Traditional Track high schoolers also have a number of extracurricular competition opportunities, from chemistry olympiads and engineering competitions to art and writing contests.


##2HS + 2 Precollege

In Years 1-2 of high school, students continue the “4+1” schedule (4-day regular, 1-day elective) but take on a double science course load. All Year 1 courses are advanced honors courses, and APs are completed in Year 2. These students will then spend their next two years (until undergraduate college eligibility) working on research projects and or supervised internships customized to accomplish their individual professional learning goals.
