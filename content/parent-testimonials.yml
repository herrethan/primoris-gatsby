    post: Primoris Academy has impacted our child`s life, and ours, in ways that we
      could not foresee in the beginning. He loves being with peers and the
      teachers who genuinely care. It`s such a warm and supportive environment.
      There is no other school like Primoris. It`s life changing.

    post: My daughter has truly blossomed academically and socially. All of the
      teachers are so kind to each child, truly encouraging each to their
      strengths. There is no place like Primoris. It's truly a special place.

    post: We are so happy to have found Primoris Academy. Our son was unhappy at a NYC private school, due to being unchallenged academically. We are very fortunate to have found this incredible school. The staff is beyond anything I have seen in a school before. The teachers are passionate and kind- the education is really impressive. While we are new to the school, we commute from an hour away as there is no similar learning environment for our son close to where we live. We highly recommend Primoris for an accelerated learner who wants to be continuously challenged and foster their innate curiosity.

    post: If your child is able to gain acceptance to Primoris Academy, consider yourself truly lucky. This is a school unlike any other a place of rigorous hands-on learning, innovative curriculum, dedicated teachers/staff and very talented kids. We were fortunate to be a Primoris family for one year, and left the school with a very heavy heart due to a job-related relocation (in fact, our daughter has been mapping her route back to Primoris via Google Maps ever since we left). Having experienced a number of other private and public schools, I can confidently say that there is nothing that comes close to Primoris in the tri-state area.

    post: Thinking Primoris Academy might be good for your child but aren't sure? We were once in your shoes. Primoris is a truly an amazing place for eager and gifted learners. The teachers are fantastic, and all the excitement for learning that happens there each day is incredible. And YES, these Primoris scholars -- of all ages -- are friendly toward each other and support and cheer for their fellow scholars every step of the way. I love observing the comraderie these kids have -- whether it's during normal pick-up time, aftercare hours, a school performance or other Primoris family event. (One of our twin boys, now almost 6 1/2, started at the school when he was just weeks shy of turning 4.) During the summer months, Primoris Academy's summer camp, open to all, has been a great, academically fun place for both our boys for the last three summers.
