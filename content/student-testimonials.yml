    post: In my six years of enrollment, Primoris Academy gave more to me than I
      ever could have imagined. The sense of community and closeness at Primoris
      is unlike anywhere else. Learning day after day, year after year, with the
      same tight-knit group of students fostered deep friendships and a
      completely welcoming environment that made coming to school every day
      something I genuinely looked forward to. Continuing to learn under the
      same deeply passionate teachers, as well, meant my classmates and I
      received an education better suited to each of us individually, while
      simultaneously developing meaningful and long-lasting relationships with
      our teachers-many of whom I am certain I will maintain a close connection
      with into college and my career. Academically, Primoris provided
      tremendous flexibility to pursue my passion in any way I chose, allowing
      me to take classes I was deeply and specifically passionate about, found
      school clubs and initiatives to enrich the learning experience of my
      classmates and I, and conduct my own field research under the mentorship
      of an industry expert. Primoris Academy gave me the incredible opportunity
      to attend school with my closest friends, learn from highly qualified
      teachers that truly care about their students, and pursue my interests
      with zeal and freedom, and this is something I am immensely thankful for.

    post: Primoris Academy is synonymous with innovation. Overall, the courses are
      very challenging but the school allows the students have a voice in their
      learning. The opportunities for learning are endless. The teachers here
      help spark curiosity, ignite passion, and teach you to become lifelong
      learners and thinkers. Also, the friendships I made here are one of a
      kind.
