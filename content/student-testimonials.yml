    post: In my six years of enrollment, Primoris Academy gave more to me than I
      ever could have imagined. 
      # The sense of community and closeness at Primoris
      # is unlike anywhere else. Learning day after day, year after year, with the
      # same tight-knit group of students fostered deep friendships and a
      # completely welcoming environment that made coming to school every day
      # something I genuinely looked forward to. Continuing to learn under the
      # same deeply passionate teachers, as well, meant my classmates and I
      # received an education better suited to each of us individually, while
      # simultaneously developing meaningful and long-lasting relationships with
      # our teachers-many of whom I am certain I will maintain a close connection
      # with into college and my career. Academically, Primoris provided
      # tremendous flexibility to pursue my passion in any way I chose, allowing
      # me to take classes I was deeply and specifically passionate about, found
      # school clubs and initiatives to enrich the learning experience of my
      # classmates and I, and conduct my own field research under the mentorship
      # of an industry expert. Primoris Academy gave me the incredible opportunity
      # to attend school with my closest friends, learn from highly qualified
      # teachers that truly care about their students, and pursue my interests
      # with zeal and freedom, and this is something I am immensely thankful for.

    post: Primoris Academy is synonymous with innovation. Overall, the courses are
      very challenging but the school allows the students have a voice in their
      learning. The opportunities for learning are endless. The teachers here
      help spark curiosity, ignite passion, and teach you to become lifelong
      learners and thinkers. Also, the friendships I made here are one of a
      kind.

    post: As a student, this school is the best school ever! Really nice 
      teachers, no bullying problems at all, extremely advanced, even innovative
      Wednesdays, where there are electives and you can choose your own classes!
      Awesome school! I wish I could rate it 6 stars...
